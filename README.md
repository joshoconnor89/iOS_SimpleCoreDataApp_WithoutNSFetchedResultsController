# iOS_SimpleCoreDataApp_WithoutNSFetchedResultsController
Simple Core Data Example (not using TableView/NSFetchedResultsController)

This project is authored by Josh O'Connor.  It is a simple core data app with all CRUD methods ran
and NSLogged for your convenience.  If you are interested in using TableViews, take a look into
my other Git project which features the NSFetchedResultsController for CoreData and TableViews here:

This project is labeled for reuse.
